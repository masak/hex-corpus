For years I've been wanting to build a corpus of LittleGolem hex games, that I
could then analyze with various algorithms. This is that corpus.

It's divided into three parts:

    hvh     hotshots vs hotshots
    hvm     hotshots vs mediocres
    mvm     mediocres vs mediocres

For the corpus, I picked out the ten highest-ranked players (**hotshots**), and
found all their games against each other. Then I found out ten
slightly-above-average players (**mediocres**) who each had at least 10 games
against hotshots, and found all games between my set of hotshots and my set of
mediocres. Finally, I found all games between my mediocres.

No offense at all meant by the terms "hotshot" and "mediocre", by the way. They
are but simple mneminocs for myself.

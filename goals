* finish up catalogue-links. it finds all formations in all games in the
  corpus, normalizes each of them, and dies if it doesn't recognize one. the
  idea is to get a good picture of how links may conflict within and between
  group connections.

* follow up on the idea that tether links can be found relatively cheaply by
  looking for a small set of patterns. do this with tests. steal liberally
  from groups-by-tests when doing so. maybe integrate learnings into
  groups-by-tests.

* integrate the new tether-finding strategy back into catalogue-links. see if
  any new formation types fall out.

* come up with an abstracted way to build groups from all the link information
  between chains. do this with tests. use the data from catalogue-links as
  inspiration.

* build an HTML page for each move in each game.

* incorporate the group/formation information into the HTML page.

* try out MCTS as seen in

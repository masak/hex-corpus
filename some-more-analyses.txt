1. unusual (but strong) starting move; should swap
2. escape for left side
3. block
4. higher escape
5. invading on the right
6. escape for right
7. invading on the left
8. minimax
9. lowering the access to the escape from above
10. minimax (?)
...
13. trying to prevent the two groups from connecting
14. connecting well to the right, but unclear on the left
15. widening the rift on the left
16. trying to go above instead
17. defending, probably connected to top now
18. back to trying to connect below on the left; dubious
19. blocking
20. bottleneck
21. connecting to top
... then a ladder along the bottom; white resigns

Interesting game. A lot of subtle threats.

27. This turns out to be the crucial move in the game

A nice win for white. Lots of stools.

27. This move is almost certainly a mistake. It's brave, though.
...
32. Here is where I see that white will win, in hindsight. All except L2 are basically one connected group.

25. This move indicates that white has made a mistake, by not engaging. Is black connected? I don't quite see it.
